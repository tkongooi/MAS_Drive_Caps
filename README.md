3) Note that the stl file might appear to be 10x times larger due to to a unit discrepancy between cm and mm. You might want to rescale it by a factor of 10 to ensure a correct dimension.

4) The ipt and stl files included in the SI are the designs after iterative corrections adapted for Form3+ (Formlabs). We have added uncorrected designs due to external request. Nevetheless, these designs were based on our personal measurement, and we do not guarantee that it is 100 % correct.
